# Impact-of-Image-Augmentation-Techniques-in-AI
Objective: Measure the impact of data augmentation techniques on a baseline model 


Tasks:
- Implementation of Image processing: A minimum of five data processing techniques relevant to your dataset.
- Mix and match methods to optimise your model performance.
- Training model with the original data, with and without data augmentation, with only the augmented data, using both original data and augmented data
- Evaluation: Compare the model's performance with and without data augmentation. Metrics to consider (accuracy).
- Discussion: Discuss finding and reason the impact of data augmentations on the performance of the models, and the impact of the nature of the dataset on your choice of augmentation methods and the model performance
